A program made with Python, OpenPyXL and Folium that shows the best restaurants in Cape Town, South Africa.

The program takes data from the xlsx file using OpenPyXL including the latitude and longitude coordinates, the street address and images. 
The mapping.py file then uses the Folium library to translate this into a map HTML file which includes interactive Lat and Lon points. 
These points include information about the restaurants as well as links to their various pages for those who have never been before.
